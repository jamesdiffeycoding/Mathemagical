# Project initiated with create react app vite

- created with npm create vite@latest
- key media breakpoints at 1400px width
--- this is currently turned off while there is only one graph on the site, check the commented out media query to reinstate it
--- the graph width is 600px, so about 1400px is needed to house two graphs side by side
- to run local server, cd into mathemagical and run npm i + npm run dev



# For later
- a useful document on canvas responsiveness
